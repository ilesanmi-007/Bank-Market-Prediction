# Bank Market Prediction

This project is about Building a predictive model to predict whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not

Model used is Logistic Regression

Along the way it was seen that if the model had predicted null(0) for all customer, it would have had an accuracy above 50% due to imbalance data.
Hence the need to deal with the imbalance data.

The method used are:
1. Oversampling the minority
2. Undersampling the majority
3. SMOTE

their accuracies and f1 score were about the same values but SMOTE seems to be higher.


I look forward to deploying this model
